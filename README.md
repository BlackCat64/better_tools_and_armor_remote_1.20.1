# Better Tools and Armor

Overview
--------

Better Tools and Armor is not just another overpowered toolpack mod. It aims to overhaul Minecraft's progression system by extending it past Netherite and adding more player choice, all while encouraging exploration.

Many new ores and resources are added, each of which spawning in unique locations. Every tool/armor-set in the mod is designed to have a unique feel to it. For example, Sapphire tools can freeze your opponents!

**Crystallite** is the largest feature in the mod. Found underground, similarly to Amethyst Geodes, Crystallite can be used to craft equipment which is more powerful than Netherite! Every piece of Crystallite gear can be upgraded in 16 different ways, to gain a special ability. Each upgrade is part of a set, which has a theme based on the material it is crafted with. Some upgrades make gear more powerful, while others extend its utility. **The choice is yours!**

On top of all this, BT+A adds a whole heap of other features designed to fit well into Survival Minecraft, with a kind of vanilla-plus feel to them.

Development
-----------
I develop this mod using the popular mod-making software [**MCreator**](https://mcreator.net/).
MCreator makes mod development easier by handling all of the base mod files for you, and generating Java code based on a block-style programming interface. Hence why most code in this repository is auto-generated. This is much more in-depth than the likes of Scratch, however, since for more complex features such as the Crystallite Bow, actual Java programming is required. Also, for debugging, a high level of knowledge of Minecraft game mechanics and common programming errors is required, since normal Java error messages are shown.
I use this Git repository with the [Remote Workspaces](https://mcreator.net/plugin/97468/remote-workspaces-support-20232) plugin for MCreator, which provides a GUI for carrying out Git commands such as `git push` and `git pull` automatically.

Other MCreator plugins this project depends on:
* [Attributes](https://mcreator.net/plugin/103319/attributes-nerdy-edition)
* [Item Tooltips](https://mcreator.net/plugin/92306/item-tooltips)
* [Just Enough Recipes](https://mcreator.net/plugin/103347/just-enough-recipes)
* [Loot Modifier](https://mcreator.net/plugin/103828/loot-modifier)
* [Metadata Editor](https://mcreator.net/plugin/93503/metadata-editor)
* [Nerdy's Curios API Plugin](https://mcreator.net/plugin/90992/nerdys-curios-api-plugin)

More recently, I have started developing a mod without the aid of MCreator: The [Big Signs Mod](https://github.com/BlackCat64/big_signs_mod).
